better-writing.vim
===
Improve your writing by avoiding weasel words and passive phrases.

Inspired by [@mislav's awesome dotfiles](https://github.com/mislav/dotfiles/tree/master/bin).

better-writing.vim highlights weasel words and passive phrases to help you kick them out of your writing.

Weasel words are words that  don't mean much but sneak into your text. This vim plugin will highlight them in red so that you can delete them.

Passive phrases are often less readable. better-writing will highlight them in orange.

Usage
